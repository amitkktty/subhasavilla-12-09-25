                                </a>

                                        A Ticket Management System (TMS) is a software tool or platform used to manage,
                                        track, and resolve customer service requests, IT support issues, or other types
                                        of service inquiries within an organization. The system organizes tickets
                                        (requests or issues) in a centralized manner, allowing teams to efficiently
                                        manage, prioritize, and address them.

                                        Ticket management systems are widely used in industries like customer support,
                                        IT help desks, and service-based businesses to ensure that requests are handled
                                        in a timely and organized manner.

                                        A Desk Management System (DMS) is a software tool or platform designed to
                                        streamline and automate the management of desk spaces, especially in
                                        environments where employees, customers, or visitors need to reserve or manage
                                        shared workstations or desk assignments. Itâ€™s commonly used in flexible office
                                        spaces, coworking spaces, and hybrid work environments, but it can also apply to
                                        other settings where desk allocation and resource management are important.

                                        IVR (Interactive Voice Response) is an automated telephony system that interacts
                                        with callers through pre-recorded messages and voice prompts. It allows
                                        customers to navigate menus, access information, and perform tasks like checking
                                        balances or placing orders, all without the need for a live agent. IVR enhances
                                        customer service efficiency.

                                        Digital marketing refers to the use of online platforms, channels, and
